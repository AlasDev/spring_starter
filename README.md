# SpringBoot Project

Simple [springboot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) project i'm exercising with during my first internship.

## Project makes use of:

- **Lombok**: To reduce boilerplate code (getter/setter, constructors, ...)
- **MapStruct**: For automatic mapping of objects (example: Entity <-> DTO)
- **Exception handling** Common exceptions thrown on runtime are intercepted by an exception handler
- **Authentication** A token is issued to Users when they pass the login process
